# Optimal Portfolio Allocation
This project focuses on optimizing asset allocation in an investment portfolio for a firm managing client portfolios. The goal is to develop a program that determines the optimal distribution of assets to maximize expected return while keeping risk within a specified tolerance level.  

Two approaches are implemented and compared:  
1. Brute Force: Exhaustively evaluates all possible allocations.  
2. Dynamic Programming: Efficiently computes the optimal allocation by breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems.
